# Abstract:

A home means a future, stability. Every person's dream is to buy a dream house once in their lifetime and maybe sell it eventually for profit. Living a California dream is becoming more difficult each day. There are a lot of job opportunities here with great weather, lifestyle, and housing demand is on the rise.

According to the state housing department, California needs to build 180,000 new houses every year in order to keep up with demand, which is very high, there is a big valley between supply and demand. It is very important to know where you invest your money and get maximum benefit. To make a successful purchase and quote a price that will convert, one has to know about the market, buying/selling conditions, and other multiple factors which are difficult to keep up with.

In our project, we proposed to predict the price of houses in California by analyzing and visualizing the historical data and using machine learning algorithms we trained a model that will predict the price. We have followed the CRISP-DM phases and trained regression model to predict the house prices based on the attributes like - area, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, zip code and listing type. The application is implemented with StreamLit and is hosted on the AWS cloud.
